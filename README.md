# candidate-recommendation
Software engineering recruiters receive hundreds or even thousands of applications for a particular job role. Recruiters have to go through individual resumes to filter the best set of candidates. This process is time-consuming, and when the applicant list is big, it is impossible to go through all the profiles resulting in the possible exclusion of suitable candidates. It is to be noted that many of the resumes contain a GitHub profile link, and these profiles can be beneficial in determining if the candidate can be a good fit for a job role. As such, we pulled the publicly available dataset from GitHub, mined it, and built models to find similarities between users. We also developed metrics to measure users' contributions and a recommendation system using these metrics. Recruiters looking to hire software engineering candidates can use this recommendation system to filter candidates based on the recommendations. To build the recommendation system, we use a network-based approach and a machine learning approach. Finally, we evaluate the system on a real dataset collected from Github public API and present the result.
